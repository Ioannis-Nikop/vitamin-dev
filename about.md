### ...VitaminDev

**What is VitaminDev?**

VitaminDev is a blog that gathers and compares coding principles and best practices across different languages and technologies to solve the problems under study.

**Why does VitaminDev exist?**

Because I work on improving my personal and professional skills, and would like to share my journey with you. In specific, I aim to identify one (development, system, structure etc.) problem per post and try to conclude to the best solution by analyzing and comparing alternatives.

**Where do you look for information?**

The main source of information are methodologies and practices suggested by the academia and/or the industry.

**Why should I be interested?**

Because you are also passionate about learning the best practices and applying them on your daily development projects. Feel free to join in my exploration journey and let’s become together (even) better software engineers!

#### P.S
VitaminDev’s **code principles** are writing clean, well-organized and well-documented software programs that are simple enough, do what they should, solve the problem they are supposed to and are maintainable. Clean code is highly beneficial, especially in the corporate context where problems are easily escalated and need complex solutions. “Quick and dirty” code cannot align with complexity, while best practices and methodical approaches seem to be the winners.

### ...Me

I will let the code do the introductions..

> Since my main profile page is a Linkedin profile, why not add a call to Linkedin's API to get the personal data and then present them in a nice custom UI?

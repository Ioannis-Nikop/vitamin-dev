First post and we need to break the ice. So, let’s start by introducing myself and this blog.

My name is **Ioannis Nikopoulos** (my friends call me John and so should you) and I am an experienced Software Engineer with strong professional background in SAP custom development (ABAP language). Despite the language or the system I am working on, there are some principles I always follow and they are all about clean code. I believe in writing clean, well-organized and well-documented code that is simple enough, does what it should, solve the problem it is supposed to and is maintainable. **Clean code** is highly beneficial, especially in the corporate context where problems are easily escalated and need complex solutions. “Quick and dirty” code cannot align with complexity, while best practices and methodical approaches seem to be the winner.

So, this is how **VitaminDev** was born. It is a blog that gathers and explains coding principles and best practices across different languages and technologies. Each post will be dedicated on solving a development, technical or programming problem by comparing alternative solutions (if any) and suggesting the best one I have found, with the appropriate documentation. Of course, it would be also great if you shared your thoughts with me and suggested your own solutions.

Many of the **“problems”** I will be talking about come from my own experience, either from work or my personal developments. I am working on improving my personal and professional skills, and I would like to share my journey with you. I take online lessons, I build this blog (almost) from scratch, read technical books and do personal small or medium development projects. I am still gathering everything, but feel free to visit my courses page or my github profile to see what I am up to.

Before you ask, if this blog is for you, let me tell you this. If you are also passionate about learning the **best coding** and **development practices** and how to apply them in your personal or work projects, stay tuned and even share your thoughts and questions. Join me in my exploration journey and let’s become together (even) better software engineers.
